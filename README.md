This is an experimental project.

The aim of this repo is to experiment with various string manipulation techniques to better my understanding of how Python deals with strings.
Currently, a working , although basic, version of a letter counter works within the code. This is not the final version and this will be a constant work in progress.
I am also using this as a means to better understand version control and git in general.
